Hmm...

The idea is to build something similar to splitwise but simpler. 
A web app would be perfect for the usecase (also it's easier to share). 

As I have already worked a lot on Next.js, so I decided to go with it as the app dir allows to build both the api as well as the frontend pages in the same app.

For linter, I choose biome for reasons mentioned in this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1cnsvhf/comment/lr1qi97/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Honestly I also had a bad experience from the v8 to v9 transition in eslint, so i think its a good time to try biome.

I prefer typescript as it makes dedugging easier, and tailwind is go to choice because of it's ease of use and simplicity.


Shadcn/ui is the best Ui library out there (not really a ui library though).
